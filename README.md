# Knapsack
A project written for course credit in winter semester 2017/2018. 

How to run the program:

a) MyClass.java runs the program in the console.

b) GUI.java runs the program in GUI window and writes to the console some information that I thought to be important to save to compare with other inputs (i.e. chosen method (Draw/Solve/Close/Clear), number of initial items, number of algorithm, time taken to solve the problem, and value of solved knapsack).

What the program does:
 In brief, for given number of items and capacity of knapsack and given or drawn values and weights of items, the program decides which item should be packed to maximise the value of knapsack.
